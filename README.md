| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Z**    | Deletes the **selected** strip and automatically pulls neighbouring clips together so the timeline stays gap‑free. The strip does **not** need to sit under the playhead. Full Undo support. |

More time‑saving operators are on the way – stay tuned.
